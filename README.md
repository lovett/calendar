# Calendar

A calendar from an HTML file.

## Why
Desktop and web-based calendar applications are often social and business-y. They help you wrangle attendees, set up video conferencing, reserve a conference room, and block out your busyness across the days. All things I have no use for 99% of the time.

Calendar UIs also tend to need a lot of clicking around to get anything done. The standard thing is to have a form-based interaction that by necessity dictates what you can and cannot do. While an offline calendar could be thought of as a document, an online calendar is more of a database. Working with a database isn't the same as working with your grocery list or next novel.

The premise of this application is that an HTML document can act like a database if the conditions are right. And that editing a document in a text editor and viewing it in a browser is nicer than juggling both simultaneously.

Certain things are missing--there's no sync, share, or invite. This approach will not work for everyone. But it can work.
